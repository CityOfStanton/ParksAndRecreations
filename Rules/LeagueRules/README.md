## Common League Rules

### Youth League Drafting

Some youth leagues at Stanton City Park operate as competitive leagues where scores are kept and standings are maintained throughout the season. To ensure fair and balanced team composition, all competitive youth leagues utilize a structured draft process.

#### Draft Structure

**Serpentine Draft Order**: The draft employs a serpentine (snake) draft format, meaning the draft order alternates in each round. Rounds progress as follows: Round 1 goes 1, 2, 3... in order. Round 2 reverses to 3, 2, 1... in order. This pattern repeats for each subsequent round, ensuring that no team consistently picks before or after others.

#### Draft Coordinator

A **Draft Coordinator** is assigned by the Stanton Parks & Recreations board to oversee and manage all aspects of the draft. The Draft Coordinator serves as a neutral party to ensure the draft runs fairly and according to established rules. The Draft Coordinator will not be a coach in the league.

#### Reserved Players

Teams may reserve players before the draft begins under the following conditions:

- Each team may designate **one Head Coach and one Assistant Coach** maximum.
- If both the Head Coach and Assistant Coach have children or players in the league, those coaches may reserve their players before the draft begins.
- **Each reserved player will cost the team one draft pick**. For example, if a team reserves two players, they will forfeit their first two draft picks.
- A team may reserve a **maximum of two players** for drafting purposes.
- Reserved players must be declared before the draft begins.

#### Draft Authority

The Draft Coordinator has the authority to make adjustments to draft day procedures and rules as needed during the draft to ensure fairness and maintain competitive balance. Any rule modifications will be announced to all teams before implementation.
