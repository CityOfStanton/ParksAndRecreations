# Stanton Parks and Rec Youth Soccer Rules

## General Park Rules

All participants will adhere to the [Stanton City Park Rules](../../README.md), without exception.

## Drafting 

This league will follow the [Stanton City Park Youth League Drafting](../README.md#youth-league-drafting) rules.

## League Rules and Development Guidelines

These guidelines outline the core skills and concepts we aim for players to learn at each age division. Our primary objectives are for players to enjoy the game, build friendships, develop a love for soccer, learn proper fundamentals, and continue playing as they grow. Coaches are always welcome to teach beyond these guidelines; however, the items listed below represent the foundational expectations for each division.

### Message to Players, Coaches, and Parents

Our league is dedicated to creating a fun, positive, and respectful environment where players can learn, grow, and enjoy the game. We ask all players, coaches, and parents to model good sportsmanship and support one another at all times. Negative behavior, nuisance conduct, fighting, foul language, or inappropriate gestures have no place in our league. Any concerns or issues should be respectfully directed to the League Commissioner. Together, we can promote positivity, encouragement, and a love for the game both on and off the field.

**ALL GAMES WILL BE CALLED AS BEST AS THEY CAN AND THE REFEREE(S) CALL WILL STAND. QUESTIONABLE CALLS CAN BE DISCUSSED BETWEEN HEAD COACH AND REFEREE(S). COACHES GETTING OUT OF HAND AND SPECTATORS BEING RUDE AND USING PROFANITY WILL BE REMOVED FROM GAME/PARK AT REFEREE(S) CALL. ALSO, BY THE PARK AND REC ZERO TOLERANCE POLICY**

- **Goal Kicks**: Awarded when the ball exits the end line last touched by the attacking team. The ball is placed on the small box line and kicked into play by a defensive player or the sweeper.
- **Throw-Ins**: Not used. When the ball exits the sideline, the opposing team restarts play with a kick from the spot where the ball left the field.

### 8U Division

- **Format**: 7 vs. 7
- **Out of Bounds**: Play stops when the ball fully crosses the boundary line.
- **Hands**: A handball is called if the ball contacts a player below the shoulder, at the referee's discretion, unless it is a natural reaction to protect against a hard-kicked ball.
- **Goalkeepers**: One designated goalkeeper is allowed and may use both hands and feet.
- **Goalkeeper Distribution**: After gaining control of the ball, the goalkeeper may restart play by:
  - Punt – Punt the ball from anywhere within the penalty area
  - Throw – Throw the ball from anywhere within the penalty area
  - Roll – Roll the ball from anywhere within the penalty area
- **Corner Kicks**: Awarded when the ball exits the end line last touched by the defending team. Taken from the corner arc.

  - Technique:
    - Ball must be thrown with 2 hands
    - Ball must be thrown from behind and over the head
    - Both feet remain on the ground
    - No offside violations on throw-ins
- **Offside**: Attacking players may not be positioned closer to the opponent's goal than the second-to-last defender (excluding the goalkeeper). If offside occurs, play is stopped and possession is awarded to the defending team at the spot of the infraction.
- **Positions**: Emphasis on learning and maintaining positions (goalkeeper, defense, offense) and avoiding ball chasing. Coaches are encouraged to research 7v7 formations. Players should be instructed to "pass" or "shoot" the ball—not simply "kick" it.
