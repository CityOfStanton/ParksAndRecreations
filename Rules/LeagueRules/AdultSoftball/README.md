# Stanton Parks and Rec Adult Co-Ed Fall Softball League Rules

## General Park Rules

All participants will adhere to the [Stanton City Park Rules](../../README.md), without exception.

## General

### Eligibility

To be eligible, you must be 18 years old. If you turn 18 later in the season, you can be on a team, but may not participate in a game until you are 18 years old.

### Penalty

Failure to comply with any rules may result in your dismissal from the league (no refund), expulsion from the park, or banning from the park.

### Balls

1. Males and females will hit a 12” 52 COR 300 Compression softball.

2. Game balls will be provided by the league.

3. Practice balls will need to be provided by your team.

### Alcohol

1. **Use at the Park**: As per the [Stanton City Park rules](../../README.md), consumption of alcoholic beverages while playing games is **not allowed**. This includes the dugout area, spectator stands, and the parking lot. Penalty for violation of this rule will be ejection from the game. If outside alcohol is brought into the complex, the player or players will be ejected immediately, and the team will be given a warning. The next incident will result in the team forfeiting their game.

1. **Players Under the Influence**: If a player  is determined by the umpire to be under the influence of alcohol, the umpire may eject the play form the game and may also optionally eject them from park. If the players fails to comply, the police will be called and the player will be expelled from the league without refund.

### Dugout

1. **Eligible Players**: Only eligible players who are properly registered with the team shall be in the dugout during the game. While a team is batting, all players must remain completely in the dugout and out of the playing area with the following exceptions:
    1. The on-deck batter in the designated circle.
    1. One 1st base coach and one 3rd base coach in the designated areas.

### Entry Fee/Registration

1. Entry fee will be set by the league each season. This will cover the cost for game balls,  umpire fees, etc.
2. Registering a team will take place in two phases:
   1. Phase One: A person designated as the team captain will register on behalf of the team by submitting a non-refundable deposit. This person will be the single point-of-contact for the team.
   2. Phase Two: The team captain will submit the remaining payment after the first payment has been received and before the league begins.

### Schedule

1. **Seeding**: Seeding for tournament play will be based upon regular season records.

2. **Format**: The tournament will be a double elimination format. Whichever team comes out of the loser’s bracket will have to beat the team from the winner’s bracket twice in order to win the championship.

3. If a game is rained out, we will try our best to make these games up before tournament play begins.

### Unsportsmanlike Conduct

1. Profanity, verbal abuse, or any threats toward game umpires, scorers, administrators, or representatives before, during, or after the games will not be tolerated and is grounds for suspension from the program for up to one year as determined. Any profanity that the umpire or site supervisor deems inappropriate will be addressed by:
   1. Verbal warning
   1. Ejection from the facility
   1. If the offender fails to leave the complex, local law enforcement will be called and it will result in the team forfeiting the game.

1. Any player who, in the umpire’s judgment, purposely pushes or strikes a player to the extent that it could cause personal bodily injury will automatically be suspended from the program.

2. Anyone assaulting an umpire or representative will be banned from all adult athletics for the rest of that season plus the next year and may be prosecuted to the fullest through all legal channels.

3. Anyone starting or pursuing a fight with another player, coach, or spectator will be suspended from the program indefinitely. Any player ejected from a game will be suspended a minimum of two games and must visit with the League Director before playing another game.

## Teams

### Rosters

1. Teams consist of 6 male and 4 female players.
    1. At least 2 female players must be playing defensively at all times. The catcher must be a female.
    1. If a female player must exit the game, the team must replace that female with another female from the bench or subtract 1 male player from the lineup.
    1. A team may play with 8, but 2 female players must play at all times.
    1. A team may have a maximum of 15 players on their roster.
    1. Rosters cannot be modified once league games begin.
    1. Roster modifications after this time will need to be approved by the league commissioner.

2. **Game Time**: Game time is forfeit time. Teams not ready to play at the designated time shall forfeit. A team must have 8 players to start or finish a game. No automatic out for playing short. If a team only bats 8 players, their opponent also has the option of only batting 8.

3. All bats must be stamped.

4. Rosters can be modified until the first start time of the 3 week of games. After this time, modifications must go through the commissioner and be approved by a majority vote of team captains, excluding the captain of the team requesting the roster modification.

### Uniforms

1. Teams are responsible for providing their own uniforms.
2. Teams uniforms must match.
4. No metal cleats. Molded cleats, tennis shoes, or turf shoes are acceptable.

### Attendance

1. Attendance at each game will be recorded. You only need to be present to be counted. Attendance will count towards your tournament eligibility.

### Tournament Eligibility

1. You will need to be in attendance for 30% of your teams regular season games.

## Game Rules

### Regulation Game

1. A game will consist of 5 innings unless one of the following occurs:

2. **Time Limit**: A 1 hour 15 minute time limit will be in effect. No new inning will begin after 1 hour 10 minutes (unless tied).

3. **Run Rules**: The game will be ruled complete if a team is ahead by 15 runs after 3 innings or 10 runs after 4 innings.

4. **Ties**: In the event of a tie at the end of regulation, the game will proceed to a tie breaker inning. The inning will begin with no outs and the ‘last batter out’ on second base. Each hitter will receive only one pitch. A strike or a foul will result in an out, and a ball will result in a walk. The batter does not receive a courtesy foul during a Texas tie breaker inning. The tie breaker will continue until one team has more runs than the other at the end of a complete inning. The team with more runs will receive the win for the game, and the team with fewer runs receives the loss.

### Pitching

1. This is a slow-pitch league.

### Batting

1. Batters will start with a 1-1 count.

2. There will be 1 courtesy foul ball.

3. **Home Run Rule**: Each team will be allowed 1 over-the-fence home run per inning. Once you have hit an over-the-fence home run in that inning, all other over-the-fence home runs will be counted as a batted out. In-the-park home runs do not count against your home run limit.

### Base Running

1. **Courtesy Runners**: One courtesy runner per inning (one time) may be used. The courtesy runner can be any player on the roster. Once the courtesy runner occupies the base, the selected courtesy runner may not be exchanged for any other desired courtesy runner. If the courtesy runner is still on base at the time his/her turn at bat comes up, that spot in the batting order will be an out.

2. In the Co-Ed League, a male player in the roster may run for a male, and a female player in the roster may run for a female. Both a male and female player may opt for a courtesy runner in each inning.

## Commissioners Discretion

1. The commissioner, at their discretion, can amend, add, or remove any rule during the season. This is typically done to maintain balance and stability with the league.
