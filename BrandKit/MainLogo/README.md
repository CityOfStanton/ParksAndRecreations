# Description

The logo contains the "Stanton" name in white on the center of a black banner. There is a thick circular border around the image, acting as a frame for the inner scene. The northern hemisphere of the image contains a mountain landscape in the background. There are two birds and two clouds in the sky. Along the base of the southern hemisphere from left to right is a park bench, a tree, a family of 4, and two swings. The southern hemisphere consists of banded green bars that alternate between a lighter and darker green. The text "Parks & Rec" is stylistically written over the bars in the southern hemisphere. The top arched text in the frame border reads "Adventure Is Local" while the bottom arched text reads "Powell County Kentucky".
