# Description

The logo has the standard Stanton Cty Park frame, consisting of the center banner, bottom arched text, and "Parks & Rec" in the southern hemisphere. The unique aspect of the image is the inner background is composed of the pentagonal sections of a soccer, making the inner background resemble a soccer ball. There are connecting lines between the sections meant to represent the stitching on a soccer ball.
