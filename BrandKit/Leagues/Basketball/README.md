# Description

The logo has the standard Stanton Cty Park frame, consisting of the center banner, bottom arched text, and "Parks & Rec" in the southern hemisphere. This has the black/color bars in the southern hemisphere. This is a common element for the league logos. The unique aspect of the image is the basketball scene taking place featuring a player shooting a jump shot on the left goal as another player is attempting to dunk the basketball on the right goal. There are two clouds above the players.
