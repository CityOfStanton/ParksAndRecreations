1. The city park shall be open to the public from sunrise until 9:00 pm for anyone under 18. Anyone under 18 must be accompanied by a guardian after 9:00 pm. (City-sponsored or approved events that are open to the public are exempt from this time.)

2. No alcoholic beverages are permitted within the city park.

3. No motor vehicles or motor-assisted vehicles shall be operated within a park area not specifically designated or designed for vehicular use. Driving across ball fields, courts, or walking paths is prohibited.

4. No person shall park or store any motor vehicle, motorcycle, ATV, bicycle, or other vehicle within the park except in paved areas designated for such purpose.

5. Vehicular parking shall be prohibited during hours when the park is closed. Vehicles parked in violation of this are subject to ticketing by the City of Stanton Police Department. Said vehicles may be towed at the owner's expense.

6. Small cooking fires are permitted but must be confined to the grills provided, fireplaces, or privately owned grills and must be completely extinguished before the user leaves the area and no later than 9:00 pm.
